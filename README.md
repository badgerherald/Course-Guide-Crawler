UWMadCrawler
============

A Scrapy spider script to crawl the UW-Madison course register


## How To Use
This program uses [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/), an open source web scraping library designed using Python. To learn more, check out the [Docs](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/overview.html)

First, install the project's dependencies with pip:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then run the following command in the UWMadCrawler/ directory to run the crawler:

    cd UWMadCrawler
    scrapy crawl UWMad

This will crawl the website and print out the courses on the register.

## Notice
This program is in heavy beta, as are the docs. Please stay tuned for updates and updated documentation.
